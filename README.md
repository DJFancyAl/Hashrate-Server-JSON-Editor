# Hashrate-Server-JSON-Editor

This is a Python script to convert your JSON files. It works by reformatting all of the files in a specified directory. To use the script:

1. Run the Python script in your console - something like `py covert.py`

2. The script will prompt you for the path of the directory containing your JSON files. (all of the files in this directory must be Hashrate JSON files)

3. Press enter and watch the magic.

- The script will create an "old" backup version of each file in case something goes wrong.
